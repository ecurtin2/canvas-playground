# canvas-playground

This is me practicing canvas form the [Mozilla Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).
The reason I was doing this was to prepare myself for teaching the [We All Code](https://www.weallcode.org/) volunteer organization.
